Here are some of the bots I made 2 years ago, when I was 12 years old. Unfortunately, my last laptop broke, and I lost about 2 years in progress of bot development as a result. I learned the hard way that I should have used an external backup system!

Please keep in mind that my current work is far more advanced. However, since applications for this opportunity close tomorrow, I had to present what I had available. Please also keep in mind that since I was 2 years younger when I wrote these bots scripts I was still immature and had a lot of fun naming my variables. since then, I have worked with friends in a team setting and have learned that simplicity is important, both in code as well as variable naming.
